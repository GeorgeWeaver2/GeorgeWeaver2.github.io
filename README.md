 Hi you have reached my Analytics portifolio. Most of my analytics projects are focused  using Excel to extract relationships between data that i have gotten and then transferring that into Tableau or PowerBI presentaition as needed. The link to each are below

**Amerisource Bergen Project:**
My First Project was for AMerisource Bergen, a major prescription manufactorer, that was losing revenue because its client pharamacies were buying prescriptions outside of the Prefered Vendor Agreement (PVA).My team was
given 3 items to help us idetify a possible cause to this issue: the phramacy transaction log, a data dictionary explaining the terms in the transaction log, and a "PRN to family" documents which matched drug PRN number to its "family".  My team had about a month to finish this

BAckground information:
- The company had a network of geographic pharmacy groups which solve various prescrion medications.
- The amount of Medications "over-dispenced:" is determined by taking " number of units dispeced - number of units purchased"
- Different products have a different number "dispensable items" per unit, such ad vials vs tablets per box

Questions:
1. Which drug families appear to be purchased outside the PVA most often?
3. Is leakage based on quantity? Based on $? Based on Therapeutic Class or disease state?
4. Is price always the cause of leakage? Or are there other reasons for it?
5. Where should AmerisourceBergen focus its efforts to reduce leakage to regain revenue and profit?

My Process
1) I did some reasearch on the teh data dictionary terms and how they applied to each other so that I had some background knowledge
2) Imported of the the documents into Excel so that I could Vlookups and Pivot tables in needed.
3) Since we 3 weeks remaining to complete and present our work, we divided up which variable each of us would test. We evaluated, geographic pharamcy groups, drug Family, week number regardless of pharamcy group and with pharmacy group, brand vs generic, and drug PRN.  Due to the large number or transactions we all chose a group of drug PRNS
4) I researched pharmacy Groups, and teh PRNs realted to blood sugar control, weight management, and pain management


Results:
1) I found that 91% of lost was coming from only half of the pharamcy groups, and blood sugar control prescriptions were over dispensed  by __
2) My collegues found that PRNs related to controlling breathing over dispended.
3) we found that most prescripts were less thna 10%

consultions
We needed a possible cuasefor this an found that phramacies tended to keep a heavy reserve of "emergency" p0rescription to ensure that they could fill prescriotiions even if the delivery trucks were delayed. It may have beena buffer again the time risk of Just in time logistics
