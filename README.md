 Hi you have reached my Analytics portifolio. Most of my analytics projects are focused  using Excel to extract relationships between data that i have gotten and then transferring that into Tableau or PowerBI presentaition as needed. The link to each are below

My First Project was for AMerisource Bergen, a major prescription manufactorer, that was losing revenue because its client pharamacies were buying prescriptions outside of the Prefered Vendor Agreement (PVA).My team was
given 3 items to help us idetify a possible cause to this issue: the phramacy transaction log, a data dictionary explaining the terms in the transaction log, and a "PRN to family" documents which matched drug PRN number to its "family". A prescription family is its medical use, such as "blood clots"

Questions:
1. Which drug families appear to be purchased outside the PVA most often?
3. Is leakage based on quantity? Based on $? Based on Therapeutic Class or disease state?
4. Is price always the cause of leakage? Or are there other reasons for it?
5. Where should AmerisourceBergen focus its efforts to reduce leakage to regain revenue and profit?

My Process
1) I did some reasearch on the teh data dictionary terms and how they applied to each other so that I had some background knowledge
2) Imported of the the documents into Excel so that I could Vlookups and Pivot tables in needed.
3) My first goal was to create several tables in Excel to get 2 baselines, The total amount of prescriptions over dispended per time period, and which prescripts caused it.
